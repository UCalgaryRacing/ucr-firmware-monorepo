General goals:
	- For someone to get a fresh new laptop and start developing for us, all they need is:
		1. Install VSCode
		2. Clone the monorepo
		3 (optional). Install STM32CubeMX if they want to change pin assignments, core configurations, etc. Not necessary to just work on the code for a specific function of a controller.











Software Architecture:

Application should never directly use HAL drivers except for basic MCU initialization (setting up clocks etc). Generally, if an application wants to do a thing that requires HAL drivers (or otherwise makes sense to be abstracted), it should use a Component.

Components are free to use HAL drivers but further abstraction should be used where it makes sense (ie a "PDM" component should use a further "VNF9Q20F" component to access HAL drivers for controlling a VNF9Q20F, but it makes sense for the PDM component to directly access HAL drivers to say toggle a GPIO controlling an LED on the PDM PCB)


Open items:

 - Datalogging arch stuff:

    -ADC:

        Option #1 (chosen): Set up a component that has a configuration of all the ADC channels and is just polling (or DMA or whatever) all the time and publishing those values for a DAQ (logger) component and any other component (ie PDM) that wants to know those values
            - This sounds like something that might already be done purely in hardware by the STM32H7 ADC peripheral? In that case it still might make sense to have an ADC component to abstract all the pin assignments (or will we have some other solution ala devicetree or something like that to capture this? Check what CubeMX does)

        Option #2 (stupid): Important components like PDM directly access ADC for stuff they want, and then some other component works to get those values and then also read any other ADC channels that haven't already been triggered for a read, and then send it all to logger

    -Aside from ADC inputs, How will we be logging the general state of things? Like random GPIO that are used to control ICs, and also the internal state of application/components. Do we want to log this stuff? It would be awesome to have but might get complicated
